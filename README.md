# Browser-Automation-Watsapp-using-Python
This is a simple demonstration for using python in automation of browser 
you will need to download Chrome Webdriver for this to happen 
After downloading install it and copy it to C:// then pass the path to python and follow my code, I have explained what to do in the comments of the .py code.
Also, don't forget to install selenium into your python interpreter(eg. jupyter notebook)
